# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature introduces a two-tier subscription service to the resume tailoring application, providing differentiated value between Free and Pro users. The subscription system will manage user access to features, implement usage limits, and provide different levels of resume processing capabilities. The system needs to integrate with existing authentication and resume processing workflows while adding payment processing and subscription management capabilities.

## Requirements

**User Story:** As a new user, I want to start with a free account that gives me basic resume tailoring capabilities, so that I can try the service without any financial commitment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL automatically assign them to the Free plan
2. WHEN a Free user accesses the app THEN the system SHALL display their current usage (X of 5 weekly sessions used)
3. WHEN a Free user has used 5 sessions in a week THEN the system SHALL prevent additional resume processing until the next week
4. WHEN a Free user attempts bulk processing THEN the system SHALL restrict them to single job processing only
5. IF a Free user tries to access Pro features THEN the system SHALL display an upgrade prompt

### Requirement 2

5. WHEN a Pro user cancels their subscription THEN the system SHALL maintain Pro access until the current billing period ends

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Pro user, I want to choose between Light and Heavy resume processing modes, so that I can control the depth of AI modifications based on my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pro user starts resume processing THEN the system SHALL present options for "Light Tailoring" and "Heavy Tailoring"
2. WHEN "Light Tailoring" is selected THEN the system SHALL make minimal, targeted changes focusing on keywords and key phrases
3. WHEN "Heavy Tailoring" is selected THEN the system SHALL perform comprehensive restructuring and content optimization
4. WHEN a Free user processes resumes THEN the system SHALL use a standard tailoring level (equivalent to Light)
5. WHEN processing is complete THEN the system SHALL indicate which tailoring mode was used

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Pro user, I want access to advanced formatting options, so that I can customize my resume appearance beyond basic templates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Pro user downloads a resume THEN the system SHALL offer multiple formatting styles and layouts
2. WHEN a Pro user selects advanced formatting THEN the system SHALL provide options for custom fonts, colors, and section arrangements
3. WHEN a Free user downloads a resume THEN the system SHALL provide only the standard professional format
4. WHEN formatting is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain ATS compatibility across all format options
5. IF advanced formatting fails THEN the system SHALL fallback to standard formatting with user notification

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Pro user, I want access to premium cover letter templates and resume analytics, so that I can enhance my entire job application package.

5. WHEN analytics are generated THEN the system SHALL update in real-time based on user activity

### Requirement 6
