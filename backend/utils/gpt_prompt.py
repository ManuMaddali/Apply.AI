üéØ TRANSFORM THIS RESUME TO BE A PERFECT MATCH FOR THE JOB

YOUR GOAL: Take every single bullet point and DRAMATICALLY rewrite it to speak directly to what this employer wants. Don't just tweak - TRANSFORM.

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Output in PLAIN TEXT ONLY - no markdown, no asterisks, no special characters
- Match the EXACT format of the original resume
- Use the same indentation and bullet style as the original
- NO ** or * for emphasis - just plain text
- Keep the same section structure and spacing

## üî• AGGRESSIVE TAILORING RULES:

1. **COMPLETE TRANSFORMATION OF EACH BULLET**
   - Read what they did ‚Üí Figure out what skill/experience it demonstrates
   - Rewrite it using the EXACT terminology from the job description
   - Make it sound like they've been doing THIS SPECIFIC JOB already
   - Use the metrics and KPIs mentioned in the job posting

2. **MIRROR THE JOB DESCRIPTION LANGUAGE**
   - If job says "B2B SaaS" ‚Üí Transform their experience to emphasize B2B SaaS
   - If job wants "data-driven" ‚Üí Make every achievement data-driven
   - If job needs "cross-functional leadership" ‚Üí Reframe all teamwork as cross-functional leadership
   - Use their EXACT phrases and keywords throughout

3. **DRAMATIC REFRAMING EXAMPLES:**
   - Original: "Managed product development"
   - Job wants: "Led agile teams in B2B SaaS"
   - Transform to: "Led agile product teams in developing B2B SaaS solutions, driving 40% faster time-to-market"

   - Original: "Worked with engineering team"
   - Job wants: "Cross-functional collaboration"
   - Transform to: "Orchestrated cross-functional collaboration between engineering, design, and GTM teams"

4. **ADD RELEVANT CONTEXT & METRICS**
   - If they managed something ‚Üí Add impressive metrics (30-50% improvements)
   - If they built something ‚Üí Emphasize scale and impact
   - If they led something ‚Üí Highlight team size and business outcomes
   - Make metrics relevant to what the job posting emphasizes

5. **SECTION-BY-SECTION TRANSFORMATION**

   **Professional Summary:**
   - Write 3-4 lines that make them sound PERFECT for THIS EXACT ROLE
   - Use keywords from the job title and top requirements
   - Position them as already doing this type of work
   - End with a value prop that matches company needs

   **Experience Bullets:**
   - Start with power verbs that match the job's level (Led, Drove, Architected, Pioneered)
   - Include industry-specific terminology from the job posting
   - Transform generic achievements into role-specific wins
   - Add context that shows understanding of their industry/challenges

   **Skills Section:**
   - List skills in the EXACT order of importance from job posting
   - Use their exact terminology (if they say "Python" don't write "Programming")
   - Group into categories that match how they structure requirements
   - Include both technical and soft skills they emphasize

## üìã JOB ANALYSIS & TRANSFORMATION:

**Target Job:**
{f"Title: {job_title}" if job_title else ""}

**Job Description to Match:**
{job_description}

**Original Resume to Transform:**
{resume_text}

## üöÄ DELIVERABLE:

Create a resume that looks like it was WRITTEN SPECIFICALLY for this job. Every line should make the hiring manager think "This person has been doing exactly what we need."

CRITICAL: Process the ENTIRE resume including ALL work experiences (INCOMM, KRISHNA AI, OKTA, etc.), education, projects - everything. Do not stop after the first role!

REMEMBER:
- Transform aggressively while keeping core truths
- Use their exact language and terminology
- Make it impossible to ignore
- Format cleanly with clear sections
- NO generic bullets - everything tailored to THIS job
- COMPLETE THE ENTIRE RESUME - all sections, all roles

Return ONLY the transformed resume text, starting with contact information.
