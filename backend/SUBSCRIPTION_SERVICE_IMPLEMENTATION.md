# SubscriptionService Implementation Summary

## Overview
Task 2 from the subscription service specification has been successfully implemented. The core subscription service backend logic is complete and tested.

## Implemented Components

### 1. SubscriptionService Class (`backend/services/subscription_service.py`)
A comprehensive service class that handles all subscription-related operations:

#### CRUD Operations for Subscriptions
- `create_subscription()` - Create new subscriptions with Stripe integration
- `update_subscription()` - Update existing subscription details
- `cancel_subscription()` - Cancel subscriptions immediately or at period end
- `get_subscription()` - Retrieve subscription by ID
- `get_active_subscription()` - Get user's active subscription
- `get_user_subscriptions()` - Get all subscriptions for a user

#### Usage Limit Checking and Enforcement
- `check_usage_limits()` - Check if user can perform actions based on tier
- `can_use_feature()` - Check access to specific features
- `get_bulk_processing_limit()` - Get bulk processing limits by tier
- `_check_weekly_resume_limit()` - Internal method for Free user limits

#### Usage Tracking and Reset Functionality
- `track_usage()` - Track user activity and update counters
- `reset_weekly_usage()` - Reset weekly usage for individual users
- `reset_all_weekly_usage()` - Batch reset for all users (scheduled task)
- `get_usage_statistics()` - Comprehensive usage analytics

#### Subscription Status Validation
- `validate_subscription_status()` - Validate and sync subscription status
- `_downgrade_expired_subscription()` - Internal downgrade logic
- `process_expired_subscriptions()` - Batch process expired subscriptions

#### Date Calculation Helpers
- `calculate_next_billing_date()` - Calculate next billing cycle
- `calculate_prorated_amount()` - Calculate prorated charges
- `get_subscription_renewal_date()` - Get renewal date for user
- `days_until_renewal()` - Calculate days until renewal
- `is_in_grace_period()` - Check if user is in payment grace period

#### Analytics and Reporting
- `get_subscription_metrics()` - Admin dashboard metrics

### 2. UsageLimitResult Class
A result object for usage limit checks with:
- `can_use` - Boolean indicating if action is allowed
- `reason` - Human-readable explanation
- `remaining` - Remaining usage count
- `limit` - Total limit for the tier
- `to_dict()` - Serialization method

### 3. Enhanced User Model Integration
The service integrates seamlessly with the existing User model which already includes:
- Subscription tier and status fields
- Usage tracking counters
- Stripe customer integration
- Helper methods for subscription checks

## Key Features Implemented

### Free Tier Limitations
- 5 resume processing sessions per week
- Single job processing only (no bulk)
- No cover letter access
- No advanced formatting
- No analytics access
- Light tailoring mode only

### Pro Tier Benefits
- Unlimited resume processing
- Bulk processing up to 10 jobs
- Cover letter access
- Advanced formatting options
- Analytics dashboard
- Heavy tailoring mode
- Priority features

### Automatic Management
- Weekly usage reset for Free users
- Automatic downgrade of expired subscriptions
- Grace period handling for failed payments
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

### Business Logic
- Prorated billing calculations
- Subscription lifecycle management
- Usage analytics and reporting
- Date calculations with edge case handling

## Testing and Validation

### Logic Validation ✅
- All core business logic tested and validated
- Date calculations working correctly
- Edge cases handled properly
- Error conditions managed appropriately

### Integration Considerations
- Service designed to work with existing User model
- Compatible with FastAPI dependency injection
- Supports async/await patterns
- Proper database transaction handling

## Requirements Mapping

This implementation satisfies all requirements from task 2:

- ✅ **1.2, 1.3** - Free user usage limits and tracking
- ✅ **2.2** - Pro subscription management and validation  
- ✅ **6.4** - Subscription lifecycle and automatic management
- ✅ **8.3** - Seamless integration with existing features

## Usage Example

```python
from services.subscription_service import SubscriptionService
from config.database import get_db

# Initialize service
db = next(get_db())
service = SubscriptionService(db)

# Check if user can process resume
result = await service.check_usage_limits(user_id, UsageType.RESUME_PROCESSING)
if result.can_use:
    # Process resume
    await service.track_usage(user_id, UsageType.RESUME_PROCESSING)
else:
    # Show upgrade prompt
    return {"error": result.reason, "upgrade_required": True}
```

## Next Steps

The SubscriptionService is ready for integration with:
1. FastAPI endpoints (Task 9)
2. Stripe payment processing (Task 3)
3. Feature gate middleware (Task 5)
4. Frontend components (Tasks 10-14)

## Files Created

1. `backend/services/__init__.py` - Services package initialization
2. `backend/services/subscription_service.py` - Main service implementation
3. `backend/test_subscription_service.py` - Comprehensive test suite
4. `backend/validate_subscription_logic.py` - Logic validation script
5. `backend/validate_subscription_service.py` - Service validation script
6. `backend/test_subscription_integration.py` - Integration test script

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

Task 2 "Implement core subscription service backend logic" has been successfully completed with all required functionality implemented and tested.
