## API Endpoints

### Core Analytics Endpoints

```
GET /api/admin/analytics/dashboard
GET /api/admin/analytics/subscription-metrics
GET /api/admin/analytics/conversion-funnel
GET /api/admin/analytics/user-behavior
GET /api/admin/analytics/payment-analytics
GET /api/admin/analytics/revenue-analytics
GET /api/admin/analytics/capacity-analytics
```

### System Health and Alerts

```
GET /api/admin/analytics/system-health
GET /api/admin/analytics/alerts
GET /api/admin/analytics/real-time-metrics
```

### Configuration and Export

```
POST /api/admin/analytics/configure-alert
GET /api/admin/analytics/alert-configurations
GET /api/admin/analytics/export
```

## Security and Access Control

### Admin Authentication
- Requires admin privileges (configured via `ADMIN_EMAILS` environment variable)
- JWT token-based authentication
- Rate limiting on all endpoints

### Rate Limits
- Dashboard: 10 requests/minute
- Analytics endpoints: 20 requests/minute
- Real-time metrics: 60 requests/minute
- Export: 5 requests/minute (resource intensive)

## Alert System

### Automated Alerts
The system monitors key metrics and triggers alerts when thresholds are exceeded:

1. **High Churn Rate Alert**
   - Threshold: 15% monthly churn
   - Severity: Medium
   - Channels: Email, Slack

2. **Low Conversion Rate Alert**
   - Threshold: 2% conversion rate
   - Severity: Medium
   - Channels: Email

3. **Payment Failure Spike Alert**
   - Threshold: 10% failure rate
   - Severity: High
   - Channels: Email, Slack, SMS

4. **System Capacity Warning**
   - Threshold: 80% capacity utilization
   - Severity: Medium
   - Channels: Email, Slack

### Alert Configuration
Administrators can configure alert thresholds and notification channels:

```json
{
  "alert_type": "high_churn_rate",
  "threshold": 15.0,
  "enabled": true,
  "notification_channels": ["email", "slack"]
}
```

## Data Export and Reporting

### Export Formats
- JSON (default)
- CSV (for spreadsheet analysis)

### Export Sections
- Subscription metrics
- User behavior analytics
- Payment analytics
- Revenue analytics
- Capacity analytics

### Privacy and Security
- All exported data is anonymized
- Contains only aggregated metrics
- No personally identifiable information (PII)
